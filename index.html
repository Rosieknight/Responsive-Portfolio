				<p>Hi, my name is Laura. I have a Bachelor's from UCF in History, and an AA in Business from SSC. I currently work in retail. At this point in my life, I am more than ready for a change in careers.</p>
				<p>I'm a <em><u>Star Wars</u></em> fan, though my relationship with the later books is complicated. I love to read, especially mysteries, fantasy, and science fiction. I don't have a consistent favorite book. It tends to vary based on my mood and current reading habits. There are a handful of books and stories I will frequently recommend, if asked. My recommendations really depends on what genre you want to read.</p>
				<p>I enjoy a wide variety of music, ranging from bands like the Beatles or Led Zeppelin to movie scores and soundtracks. There are a handful of songs that I consider my favorite, though these are also subject to change with mood and current listening preferences. Some of my consistent favorites include <em><u>Classical Gas</u></em> by Mannheim Steamroller, <em><u>Let It Be</u></em> by the Beatles, and the <em><u>Star Wars Main Theme</u></em>.</p>
